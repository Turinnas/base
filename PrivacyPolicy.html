<div><font class="ws14">Game Feather llc. (“Game Feather”, “we”, “our” or “us”) respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and mobile customers and recognizes the importance of protecting the information collected about you. For our practices regarding children, please see below.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal and non-personal information by Game Feather and its affiliates through the s-warp.com website (the “Site”), the mobile apps published by Game Feather llc. (the “Apps”) and Game Feather llc. programs (the “Programs”) (in this Privacy Policy, the Sites, Apps and Programs are referred to collectively as the “Platforms”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of personal and non-personal information through any apps for which Game Feather llc. is not the publisher.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">By using the Platforms, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of our Platforms.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check the Privacy Policy each time you use our Platforms to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices. Our Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated. Your continued use of our Platforms will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy. If there is a substantive or material change in the way that we use your personal information, we will notify you via email of the relevant changes or provide other prominent notice. If you choose to opt-out of or not opt-in to our changed practice, our email communication (if applicable) will contain instructions on how to do so. If such change affects children users, we will first notify and obtain the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">HOW WE PROTECT THE ONLINE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN UNDER 13</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">Game Feather takes many precautions to protect the online privacy of children. Whenever we refer to “children” in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13. Please help us in protecting children’s privacy by instructing them to never provide any personal information (full name, email address, home address, phone number, etc.) without your permission.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">Game Feather follows the principles of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children, in our online services and Apps that are directed to children. If you would like to learn more about COPPA, you can refer to the “Children’s Privacy” section of the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">Currently, Game Feather llc. does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or within the child-directed portions of our Platforms except as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. If we were to collect and store personal information from children, we would obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before such collection, unless the collection of information falls within an exception that is permitted under COPPA.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">Parents who have registered their child to the Game Feather llc. Playgroup Program should understand that information, including but not limited to a child’s first name, last name’s initial, country of residence and behavioral activity within the beta version of the app tested, may be collected by Game Feather llc.. In addition, any feedback provided by beta testers may be used to make adjustments to and improve upon Game Feather llc. products including but not limited to the gameplay, app flow, story, art and animation.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">In our Apps directed to children users, we collect information which includes persistent identifiers such as a device identifier (“device ID”) or an Internet Protocol address (“IP address”). This information is collected solely for the purpose of providing functionality and support for our internal operations and optimizing our users’ game experience.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">Game Feather llc. does not permit behaviorally-targeted advertising to children in the Apps or in the Platforms where we have actual knowledge that the user is under the age of 13.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected your child’s personal information without your prior consent, you may contact Game Feather llc.’ Privacy Officer:</font></div>

<div><font class="ws14">INFORMATION COLLECTED BY Game Feather llc.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">There are two types of information that may be collected by Game Feather llc.. The first is called personal information which is information that can be used to identify a specific individual. As stated in the previous section, Game Feather llc. does not knowingly collect any personal information from children outside of the information required for the support of internal operations. Game Feather llc. may collect personal information that parents, legal guardians or persons over 13 voluntarily provide on the Platforms. The second type of information is non-personal information which doesn’t directly identify an individual. Game Feather llc. may collect non-personal information about your use of the Platforms to help us improve our services or for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</font></div>
<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">We may combine the non-personal and personal information you provide us through our Platforms.

<div><font class="ws14">Other Uses: We may also use your information for other legitimate business purposes.

<div><font class="ws14"><br></font></div>
<div><font class="ws14">In-Game Advertising: Our Platforms may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered by our Ad Provider (Unity Ads – https://unity3d.com/services/ads), which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while you play. The data collected for this purpose may include IP address or players’ user name, downloaded or purchased Apps, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. The Apps you are using may be assigned an ID number, which is stored on your device, and used by our Ad Provider to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic in-game advertising.
